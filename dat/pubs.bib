	Abstract = {We document techniques and insights gained through the creation of a series of ``artificial natures''--interactive visualizations of biologically-inspired complex systems that can evoke nature-like aesthetic experiences within mixed-reality art installations--since 2007. A common theme binding the various principles that emerge is the importance of endogenous accounts: that all perceivable forms have dynamic ontological roles within the world; that visitors become part of the ecosystem, both through immersive display and through interactions that induce presence; that the simulated world is able to autonomously originate; and that as a result interaction can lead to exploratory discovery. Details of how each of these principles have been applied in the visualization, sonification, and interaction design are given with specific examples of exhibited installations.},

	Commentary = {A peer-reviewed collection connecting theory and practice (techné) with the ontologies of interactive worlds, catalyzed by a panel discussion at the Inter-Society of Electronic Arts (ISEA) conference 2011. My chapter analyzes the challenge of creating systems that continually recreate themselves in an open-ended manner; a core problem for generative art, artificial life, and responsive environments. My contribution leverages the oft-misunderstood creative philosophy of Henri Bergson, reconciling it with computation through interactive, self-modifying and rewriting systems.},
	Abstract = {These are exciting times for world-makers. Widely-available virtual worlds, whether fully immersive virtual realities, or mixed realities that blend with or augment the real, at last appear to be imminent. This path of worldmaking is suddenly widely-backed, affordable, and accessible, with eager anticipation far beyond the catalytic space of videogames including art, design, film, architecture, information visualization, and more. It bears all the hallmarks of the birth of a new medium. The conventions have yet to be frozen, the genres crystallized, the messages of the medium deciphered. And inevitably it is being understood through a McLuhanian rear-view mirror: projecting old game tropes awkwardly into new spaces, and struggling with the loss of the frame, the cut, and the directed view of cinema. Rather than extrapolating forward from the familiar in this way, as world-makers we would rather find a path to a reach speculative goal: a creative ontology that opens upon the vast creative poiesis that the generative grains of computation make possible, making worlds that approach the open-endedness of the natural reality we inhabit, including its endless capacity to change and reveal surprisingly new and fascinating phenomena. To this end we revive the nature-inspired creative philosophy of Henri Bergson, and address the challenges and potentials of re-projecting it into interactive computational media, to illuminate a way forward.},

@article{kuchera2014immersive,
	Abstract = {This paper describes our research in full-surround, multimodal, multi-user, immersive instrument design in a large VR instrument. The three-story instrument, designed for large-scale, multimodal representation of complex and potentially high-dimensional information, specifically focuses on multi-user participation by facilitating interdisciplinary teams of co-located researchers in exploring complex information through interactive visual and aural displays in a full-surround, immersive environment. We recently achieved several milestones in the instrument's design that improves multi-user participation when exploring complex data representations and scientific simulations. These milestones include affordances for ``ensemble-style'' interaction allowing groups of participants to see, hear, and explore data as a team using our multi-user tracking and interaction systems; separate visual display modes for rectangular legacy content and for seamless surround-view stereoscopic projection using 4 high-resolution, high-lumen projectors with hardware warping and blending integrated with 22 small-footprint projectors placed above and below the instrument's walkway; and a 3D spatial audio system enabling a variety of sound spatialization techniques. These facilities can be accessed and controlled by a multimodal framework for authoring applications integrating visual, audio, and interactive elements. We report on the achieved instrument design.},

We introduce two JavaScript libraries towards this end: Gibberish.js, providing heavily optimized audio DSP, and Interface.js, a GUI toolkit that works with mouse, touch, and motion events. Together they provide a complete system for defining musical instruments that can be used in both desktop and mobile Web browsers. Interface.js also enables control of remote synthesis applications via a server application that translates the socket protocol used by Web interfaces into both MIDI and OSC messages. We have incorporated these libraries into the creative coding environment Gibber, where we provide mapping abstractions that enable users to create digital musical instruments in as little as a single line of code. They can then be published to a central database, enabling new instruments to be created, distributed, and run entirely in the browser.},

@incollection{bahng2014poetry,
	Abstract = {`Poetry of Separation' is a media artwork that utilizes an algorithmic generative editing system, selecting shots in real-time to be rendered over four screens arranged in layers. Editing in cinema reconstructs images by montage, deriving meaning from the juxtaposition of multiple shots. Although multi-screen projections have been used to present sectional montages that stress the simultaneity of events, spatially separated screens can disrupt attentiveness and affective involvement; the layered architecture avoids disruptive fragmentation. The generative editing system selects shots for the layered screens stochastically, with authorial constraints and probabilities using pre-determined shot criteria. Narrative flow and authorial intents are not damaged due to these criteria, but nevertheless unexpected effects arose from the stochastic system. The authorial intentions of improvisation and separation in the film content of `Poetry of Separations' find resonance with the automatism of the generative editing system and multi-dimensionality of the screens.},

@incollection{bahng2014digital,
	Abstract = {The instant messenger has developed as an important communication media platform. However, because of the nature of instant communication, instant messenger services place many limitations on communicating with nuance. We believe that the easy nature of digital communications tends to weaken serious aspects of personal communication such as patience and commitment. On the basis of critical perspectives, we designed the digital messenger `Digital Love Letter' (DLL)': a mobile messenger in which the expressive process of interaction is more important than the final output. The main concept of DLL is to share the process of communication using a non-instantaneous and non-multitasking interface, so that users can share their time with some similar nuances to face-to-face communication. Both writing and reading messages require concentrated attention. Thus, this paper suggests a new system of digital messenger, that is also a new method of computer-mediated communication (CMC).},

It invites visitors to experience mirror existences of themselves taking upon new roles as sources of energy and kinetic disturbance within a perpetually changing virtual ecosystem. This world displays some characteristics familiar from our own, but is populated by unfamiliar life forms singing, swimming, and breeding through sensitive motions of dark fluids. The visitors' doubles are energy fields, which emanate myriad bright fluid particles, food sources to be eaten by the virtual organisms. Visitors see, hear, and feel how they are fed to unknown species in this virtual ecosystem. The immersive multimodal environment and volumetric sensors take the visitors beyond avatar-based interaction to become embodied within a world of physical and biological activity. The installation has been presented in gallery settings and CAVE-like environments utilizing 3D depth cameras, stereographic display and surround audio. As an immersive audio-visual installation, it brings forth a world of aesthetic play through the embodiment of complex multi-layered and inter-modulating systems.

Users control the system by selecting and changing feature objectives in real-time. The system has a second-order structure in which the internal signal processing algorithms are developed according to an evolutionary process. Genotypes develop into signal-processing algorithms, and fitness is measured by analysis of the incoming audio feedback. A prototype is evaluated experimentally to measure changes of audio feedback depending on the chosen target conditions. By enhancing interactivity of an audio feedback through the intentional control, we expect that feedback systems could be utilized more effectively in the fields of musical interaction, finding balance between nonlinearity and interactivity.},

The motivation and development of the Device Server stems from the practical concerns of managing multi-user interactivity with a variety of physical devices for disparate performance and virtual reality environments housed in the same physical location. The interface of the Device Server allows users to see how devices are assigned to application functionalities, alter these assignments and save them into configuration files for later use. Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts to homogenize the ap- pearance of different control signals to applications so that users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities and easily experiment with different control configurations.},

	Abstract = {"Time of Doubles" is an immersive interactive art installation. It invites visitors to experience mirror existences of themselves taking upon new roles as sources of energy and kinetic disturbance within a virtual ecosystem, a uniquely created computational world. Visitors encounter their doubles in a deep hyper space with 3D stereoscopic projection and 3D depth cameras. The immersive projection dissolves the illusion of a window to form an entryway into a shared, co-present world, and the volumetric sensors take the visitors beyond avatar-based representation to become embodied within a world of physical simulation. This world displays some familiar characteristics as our own, but is populated by unfamiliar life-forms swimming through the sensitive motions of dark fluids and singing continuously. The visitor doubles are energy fields which emanate myriad bright fluid particles, food sources which are eaten by the virtual organisms. Visitors hear, see and feel how they are fed to unknown species in the virtual ecosystem aesthetically. Without visitors, the world-fluid is filled with life seeds that cannot grow, but with a human presence the populations explode into alien orchestras. Larger organisms leave physical residues and films behind as they pass, which constrain the fluid flows and which can be sculpted by visitor doubles.},

	Abstract = {Designing mobile interfaces for computer-based musical performance is generally a time-consuming task that can be exasperating for performers. Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces' affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.},

Our prototype maps approximations of room reverberation to tempo-scale characteristics of the audio feedback. These characteristics are generated by a combination of adaptive amplification control and a digital variable delay line in the feedback loop. Room reverberation is inferred from the feedback sound by real-time cross-correlation of input with output signals, which is used to guide the variable delay line. This variation, coupled with an adaptive gain control, determines room-dependent tempo effects.},

The artwork's subject is the chaotic and contradictory sensations found by night in the city of Seoul. In this work, the themes of disconnected and paradoxical images in urban public spaces resonate with the concepts of the multi-layered screens and generative editing system. The fragmented images are distributed over layers of screens to emphasize a chaotic and simultaneous sense of fragility that nevertheless together forms a whole. Designed for large-scale installation in urban public spaces, our artwork has been prototyped via a physical miniature, projecting by rear diffusion onto four layered screens constructed of grey sheer fabric. The audience can appreciate the montage from different angles and positions to produce different layering effects not possible in traditional 2D cinema. The generative editing system uses a dynamic Bayesian network constructed according to clips and timeline tagging. Audience members can actively contribute to the direction of the montage through a web interface, so the artwork creates different experiences by embracing the role of the audience in every screening.},

@phdthesis{wakefield2012phdthesis,
	Abstract = {In the interactive computer arts, any advance that significantly amplifies or extends the limits and capacities of software can enable genuinely novel aesthetic experiences. Within compute-intensive media arts, flexibility is often sacrificed for needs of efficiency, through the total separation of machine code optimization and run-time execution. Compromises based on modular run-time combinations of prior-optimized `black box' components confine results to a pre-defined palette with less computational efficiency overall: limiting the open-endedness of development environments and the generative scope of artworks. This dissertation demonstrates how the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency can be relaxed using reflective meta-programming and dynamic compilation: extending a pro- gram with new efficient routines while it runs. It promises benefits of more open- ended real-time systems, more complex algorithms, richer media, and ultimately unprecedented aesthetic experiences. The dissertation charts the significant differences that this approach implies for interactive computational arts, builds a conceptual framework of techniques and requirements to respond to its challenges, and documents supporting implementations in two specific scenarios. The first concentrates on open-ended creativity support within always-on authoring environments for studio work and live cod- ing performance, while the second concerns the open-endedness of generative art through interactive, immersive artificial-life worlds.},
	Commentary = {My doctoral research focused on run-time code generation and dynamic compilation for interactive computational arts.  Run-time code generation opens up a vast possibility space for execution flow, valuable both for creative sketching and authoring environments, as well as artificial life and other generative systems. Dynamic compilation can ensure the efficiency of generated code in real-time scenarios, however it has been hitherto only rarely utilized in computational arts. The theoretical framework presented in the first half of the dissertation is evaluated in the context of its application in authoring environments and interactive artworks. One such application is the Gen extension to Max/MSP/Jitter, which extends a well-known visual data-flow programming environment for audio to support efficient single-sample feedback, with novel capabilities for filter design, physical modeling etc. Gen was released as a commercial product in 2011 and has now tens of thousands of users, and has been the basis of several graduate-level courses (unrelated to the author). A second application integrates into the author’s “Time of Doubles” interactive artwork, in which populations of thousands of organisms continuously interact with users, metabolizing and reproducing on time-scales of seconds. Using code generation and dynamic compilation, each newly born organism embeds a uniquely generated, evolved piece of machine code, allowing a much greater space of behavior without compromising population size. This version of the artwork has been successfully exhibited at three international events since 2011. (Separate publications of the project contributions are in progress.)},

The computational nature of the medium has suggested algorithmic approaches to composition in the form of generative musical structure at the note level and above, and audio signal processing at the level of individual samples. In the region between these levels, the domain of microsound, we may wish to investigate the musical potential of sonic particles that interrelate both signal processing and generative structure. In this thesis I present a software platform (`Vessel') for the exploration of such potential. In particular, a solution to the efficient scheduling of interleaved sound synthesis and algorithmic control with sample accuracy is expounded.
